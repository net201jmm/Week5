<h2>National Garfield the Cat Day</h2>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This "holiday' is to celebrate the creation of Garfield witch happend on June 19th, 1978</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Garfield holds the Guinness World Record for the most syndicated comic strip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cartoonist Jim Davis, a native of Muncie, Indiana, was both born and raised in this midwestern city. In the year 1973, while serving as an assistant for T.K. Ryan's comic strip called Tumbleweeds, Davis embarked on a creative endeavor of his own. He conceived a comic strip titled "Gnorm Gnat," which, unfortunately, saw limited success and ran exclusively in the Pendleton Times newspaper of Pendleton, Indiana, from 1973 to 1975. Despite his efforts to syndicate the strip, Davis faced difficulties in finding wider distribution. He received feedback from an editor who praised his artistic skills and clever humor but believed that bugs were not relatable enough for the audience.</p>

<p>Undeterred by this setback, Davis resolved to investigate the current comic strip landscape to identify which types of animal characters were more popular. While he observed that dogs were well-represented, he noticed a lack of prominent feline characters. Drawing from his personal experiences growing up on a farm surrounded by twenty-five cats, Davis decided to create a cat protagonist that could captivate readers. And thus, the beloved character of Garfield was born.</p>
    
<p>Garfield, the central figure, drew inspiration from the cats Davis had encountered in his upbringing. In fact, Davis borrowed both the name and the personality of Garfield from his own grandfather, James A. Garfield Davis, whom he described as a large and cantankerous man. The character's name Jon Arbuckle, on the other hand, originated from a coffee commercial from the 1950s. To provide Jon with a companion for dialogue, Davis introduced a roommate named Lyman, who was named after a previous character from the Gnorm Gnat comic strip.</p>
    
<p>The final addition to this cast of characters was Lyman's dog Spot, who had to be renamed Odie to avoid any confusion with another dog named Spot featured in the comic strip Boner's Ark. Starting from 1976 and continuing until early 1978, these characters appeared in a strip titled "Jon," which also ran in the Times newspaper. The Jon comic strip remained relatively obscure until 2019 when Quinton Hoover, a YouTuber, stumbled upon digital scans of the Jon publications at the Pendleton Community Library and Indiana State Library.</p>
    
<p>Eventually, United Feature Syndicate recognized the potential of the strip and accepted it for national distribution. With a new title, "Garfield," the strip concluded its run in the Times on March 2, 1978, after being renamed in September 1977. On June 19 of that same year, Garfield made its much-anticipated nationwide debut in 41 newspapers. However, the Chicago Sun-Times initially dropped the strip after a test run, only to reinstate it due to readers' complaints.</p>
